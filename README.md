# Hi There 😁

I'm a Python developer focused on learning, problem-solving, and building a strong foundation in software development. I enjoy writing clean, readable code and steadily improving my skills through hands-on projects.

##  Primary Focus
- Python (core concepts, scripting, and application development)
- Writing maintainable and well-structured code
- Understanding fundamentals deeply rather than rushing tools

## Currently Learning
- Python best practices
- Data structures & algorithms
- Version control and collaborative workflows
- Applying theory through small, focused projects

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a solid Python foundation
- Develop real-world problem-solving skills
- Grow into a disciplined and reliable developer

Always learning, always improving.
